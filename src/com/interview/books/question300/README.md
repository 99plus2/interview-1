#Technical Interview Question

##Array
1.  Given three sorted arrays (in ascending order), you are required to find a triplet (one element from each array) 
    such that distance is minimum. Please give a solution in O(n) time complexity 
    
        Distance is defined like this : If a[i], b[j] and c[k] are three elements then 
            distance = max(abs(a[i]-b[j]), abs(a[i]-c[k]) ,abs(b[j]-c[k]))
    *HINT:*
