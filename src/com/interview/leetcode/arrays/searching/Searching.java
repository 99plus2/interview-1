 * Searching in array is a very typical algorithm, return its index if exist, return -1 if not found.
 * The condition of searching can be divided as following cases:
 *  each case will have implementations **L as Loop version and **R as Recursion version.
 *
 * 1. searching given number in sorted array,   {@link com.interview.leetcode.arrays.searching.SearchingSortedArray}
 * 2. searching first/last appearance of a given number in a sorted array with duplication. {@link com.interview.leetcode.arrays.searching.SearchingSortedArrayWithDuplication}
 * 3. searching min/max/target in a given sorted rotated array. {@link com.interview.leetcode.arrays.searching.SearchingRotatedArray}
 * 4. searching min/max/target in a given sorted rotated array with duplication.
