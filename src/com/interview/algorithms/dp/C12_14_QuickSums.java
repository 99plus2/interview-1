 *
 * Given a string of digits, find the minimum number of additions required for the string to equal some target number.
 * Each addition is the equivalent of inserting a plus sign somewhere into the string of digits. After all plus signs are inserted,
 * evaluate the sum as usual. For example, consider the string "12" (quotes for clarity). With zero additions, we can achieve the number 12.
 * If we insert one plus sign into the string, we get "1+2", which evaluates to 3. So, in that case, given "12", a minimum of 1 addition is required to
 * get the number 3. As another example, consider "303" and a target sum of 6. The best strategy is not "3+0+3", but "3+03".
 * You can do this because leading zeros do not change the result.
 * Write a class QuickSums that contains the method minSums, which takes a String numbers and an int sum. The method should calculate and return the
 * minimum number of additions required to create an expression from numbers that evaluates to sum. If this is impossible, return -1.
