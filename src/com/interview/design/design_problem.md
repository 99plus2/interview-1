    Design the data structures for a generic deck of cards. Explain how you would sub-class it to implement particular card games
2). Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: fresher, technical lead (TL),product manager(PM) 
    There can be multiple employees,but only one TL or PM. 
    An incoming telephone call must be allocated to a fresher who is free canâ€™t handle the call, he or she must escalate 
    the call to technical lead not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to PM.
